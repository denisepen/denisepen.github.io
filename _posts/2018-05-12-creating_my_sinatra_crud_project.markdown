Creating this project was so much fun and very fulfilling.  There is nothing like creating your very own (and very first) web application: writing the code, making tweaks to have it work just the way you want it to, and eventually using it for it's intended purpose.  I created an app that would allow me to log my daily workouts. It keeps track of the days that I worked out, the total time that I worked out, as well as the total mileage of all my workouts.  You can choose from a list of given exercises such as running, walking, biking, weight lifting, etc. You can also create your own exercise so that any activity that you perform can be logged into the database.  

Creating this app also alerted me to my weaknesses. After completing this project I walked away with  a list of To Do's and skills I need to brush up on before moving forward. 

The first is Git.  I am terribly afraid to use Git because I have made so many mistakes. With this project I messed up again.  When I initially began this project  I simply opened the Learn IDE and began writing the code. I worked like this for two days before I realized I needed to have the project in it's own repository. I went to youtube and watched videos and learned how to move data from one repository to another - and I moved the files successfully to their own repository.  However, when I made this move I (wrongly) assumed that I had moved the new repository into the Sinatra project repository - and therefore could simply open the Learn IDE and be in the new repository.  I was wrong. I had moved the files from the Sinatra project folder into the new repository (as I should have).  At this point I panicked and used the Ask A Question feature to get help. Fortunately, this was easy to fix and the instructor patiently walked me through the correct way to set this up - and the correct way to access the files in the future.  

I also need to improve my CSS skills because they are sorely lacking.  When I began the Flatiron curriculum I had only been teaching myself to code for a few months and I was jumping between HTML, CSS, and Javascript without ever getting a firm grip on any of them.  Though I wanted to add some incredible styling to the app I decided to leave it plain because all of the styling that I added  just looked so unprofessional and amateurish.  So on my list of To Do's is to greatly improve my CSS skills.  

Overall, I had a blast working on this project but I also plan to continue improving it as my skillset improves.
