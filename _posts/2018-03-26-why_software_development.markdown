Everyone who begins at the Flatiron School is asked the same question: “Why do you want to learn software development?”  My answer is simple: It gives me a sense of control.

I see learning new things as a way of taking control of your life. For example, I recently learned to knit. Having this skill has allowed me to create beautiful and personal gifts for my friends and family members. When I really want to give something special I no longer have to go shopping for something mundane and impersonal. I can give them a gift from the heart.

Last year I took up gardening.  I had never really grown much before. Outside of the odd flower here or there that I picked up from Home Depot every spring, I knew nothing about growing plants. So I bought books,  watched videos on youtube, talked to my neighbors and I started a garden. I built a 4’ x 20’ raised garden in my backyard. I purchased a few plant starts from the local garden center and also bought a few bags of seeds. As the plants were growing I learned about the correct way to water, the different fertilizer needs of each type of plant, the different sunlight requirements of each type, and so much more. By the end of the summer I had grown baskets of cucumbers, tomatoes, peppers,  and a variety of other veggies (and some strawberries). By learning this new skill I was able to provide my family with freshly grown produce from our backyard that had not been introduced to any pesticides or inorganic fertilizers. I knew exactly what we were eating. I had some level of control over our food supply.  

This is the exact same reason I want to learn software development. In today’s world where the majority of our daily interactions happen on our phones or some other smart device it only makes sense to learn how this all works. What is happening when I send an email or like a picture, or upload a video?  Why is the analysis of this type of data so important that it’s led to the explosive growth of the field of Data Science? Why is this data so important to companies? The answers to all of these questions and many more converge on the field of software development.  None of it is possible with the skills of software developers who write the code to make it all happen.  Software developers are shaping today’s world and will definitely have a large hand in shaping the future. I want to be a part of that.
